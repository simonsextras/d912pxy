# d912pxy - "DirectX9 to DirectX12 API proxy for Guild Wars 2"


d912pxy is a way to make games that use DirectX 9 use DirectX 12 instead, without changing any game code.

This is specifically designed for Guild Wars 2.
You can try to use it with other games; it might work.

Tool will show overlay when it installed correctly, use default hotkey Ctrl+Alt+N to toggle its mode (hide/show)

Expect some minor crashes / visual bugs.

Note: project will be achived when guild wars 2 dx11 beta ends, no support for other games are planned/in works.

# Showcase

Profiling shows that the API overhead for d912pxy is up to 86% (r255,custom config) less than that of plain DirectX9.
Real performance differs based on the scene and the hardware.

Benchmarking results on i7-7700/GTX960:

## GPU-bound scenario

16.4% to 2.5% less frame time

calculated based on API profiling & metrics data

This is affected by performance recording, and should be better in normal situations

# Installing

[**Base guide (EN)**](https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/wiki/Installing)

[**Using with other addons and overlays**](https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/wiki/Using-with-other-addons-and-overlays)

# Known bugs

**Bug**: 

Fullscreen/Alt+Enter crashing/hanging my game.

*Troubleshooting*: 

Avoid using fullscreen mode and Alt+Enter mode switching due to DXGI limitations. 
While it works and even recovers from DXGI deadlock, this is not 100% safe.
To recover from this bug manually, do soft-reboot: use Ctrl+Alt+Delete -> Logout.

**Bug**:

Crashes with 3-rd party tool/overlay/addon 

*Troubleshooting*: 

Check is your tool/overlay/addon compatible with d912pxy [here](https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/issues/38). 
If you see no comments for your case, [report crash](https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/wiki/Reporting-crashes)

**Bug**:

Pop-ins/slow loading/missing objects

*Troubleshooting*

This is normal for clean/first install as tool generates shader cache from ground up.
After shader cache is generated, load times will be much faster.
If you want to eleminate this problem once and for all, use [PSO precompile](https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/wiki/Using-PSO-precompile)
and/or ready-to-use shader [packs](https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/wiki/Shader-packs)

**Bug**

Game/installer are not starting

*Troubleshooting*

Update [MSVC](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)

**Bug**

Nothing happens when installed

*Troubleshooting*

Ensure that d3d9.dll is in game root folder or bin64 folder.
